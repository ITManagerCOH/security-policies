# CloudOnHire Security Policies

CloudOnHire has several security policies in place to properly identify, respond to, and mitigate potential security risks. All employees, vendors and contractors working with CloudOnHire must follow these policies in order to best protect CloudOnHire’s and its customers’ data.

We’ve published these publicly for transparency, so that you can see where we are in terms of security maturity. We also hope you use these to adopt similar policies and processes at your organization.

_Since these are our internal policies, some links to internal documents or resources are only visible to employees._

This repository is the source of truth for the policies available at https://geogo.in/security-policies/.

These policies were last reviewed on 2024-11-09.
